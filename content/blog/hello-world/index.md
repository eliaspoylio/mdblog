In the autumn 2020 I went on study leave to study web development. I started this blog to publish my notes on different subjects inside and outside my curriculum.
This material is also available in [this github repo](https://github.com/eliaspoylio/mdblog).

Another motivation for doing this is to have another pet project to try different tools and approaches with it.

## Why this format?

I wanted to do this with markdown files for a couple of reasons. Personally I find the format easily approachable and I do my notes using markdown. I also figured out that maybe storing everything in Github I can easily just migrate the actual content to a new platform or framework if I choose to do so. 

There's also some benefits for using static sites. The main one for this purpose is the lack of many "moving parts".
